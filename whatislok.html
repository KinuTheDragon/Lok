    <h1>What is LOK?</h1>
    To quote from the LOK puzzle book:
    <div class="quote">
        <span class="italic">Lok</span> are a fresh new kind of living beings that
        spawned in the middle of a vast, incomprehensible
        world. Help them understand
        their surroundings and guide them towards
        expansion of their civilisation.

        This book consists of hand-crafted puzzles to
        solve. Besides solving puzzles, you are also
        required to figure out most of the rules by
        yourself.

        The goal of each puzzle is to black out all
        cells in a grid.
        You do this by finding keywords and
        using their effects.
